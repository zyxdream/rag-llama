Data Scientist                                      HG Insights, Santa Barbara, CA
OCT 2015 - JUL 2017
- Developed customer-driven data services and products utilizing natural language techniques and creative statistical models.
- Collaborated with software engineers to build end-to-end data pipelines at a large scale.

M.S. Project, 2020
Paraphrasing via Transfer Learning
- Embedded double-head GPT-2 in generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate realistic paraphrases.
- Trained on paraphrase pairs and compared results to a fine-tuned double-head GPT-2 on both paraphrase/non-paraphrase pairs.
- Utilized transfer learning to improve performance.

HG Insights, 2017
Web-Snippets
- Crawled and processed 37 million sentences from over 5k hospital websites.
- Extracted potential mergers and acquisitions information using NLP techniques and statistical classification models.
- Customized SMOTE cross-validation to handle imbalanced classes.
