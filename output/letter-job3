I am impressed by Amazon's commitment to pushing the envelope in Automatic Speech Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, and Audio Signal Processing, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to further advance these areas.

Moreover, I am excited about the prospect of working with your team of talented peers, leveraging your heterogeneous data sources and large-scale computing resources to accelerate advances in spoken language understanding. I am confident that my experience in software development and my ability to quickly prototype new ideas will be an asset to the team.
